# Tree

Classes and functions

## Challenge

classes that have methods to add or to see if the tree contain the value

## Approach & Efficiency

i used classes anf recurssion
### BIG O
#### Binary Search Tree 
* add method
  * space --> Big O = O(n) --> depends on number of elements in the tree
  * time --> Big O = O(h) --> depends on the height of the tree
* contain method
  * space --> Big O = O(n) --> depends on number of elements in the tree
  * time --> Big O = O(h) -->depends on the height of the tree
